# cfp-to-trello

> Simple frontend application to export BDX I/O CFP proposals to Trello boards and cards for final ballot.

This application is used to import CFP proposals into Trello boards.

For each format of proposals (conference, quickie or hands on lab) a dedicated Trello board is created.  
All proposals are then grouped by categories and split into three thirds, from top rated to lower rated.  
For each proposal a Trello card is created and put in a Trello list specific to its track and rating, for the first two thirds. All last third proposals are put together in another Trello list.

## Install

First install the dependencies using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):
```bash
yarn
```

You then need to download manually the JSON file containing all the proposals and their votes from the CFP.
Log in to the CFP, go the proposals page and click on "Export...>JSON file".
Put the file in the [data](./data) directory and name it `export.json`  
**‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE EVER**

## Usage

Run [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) to serve the page :
```bash
yarn start
```

You then need to fill the correct organization name.  
Look for it in your Trello account, it should be in the URL when you select the organization which should contain the created boards.

You can then click on "Import" and wait for the magic to happen üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è !  
It should take from 3 to 5 minutes, depending on the number of proposals to import.
